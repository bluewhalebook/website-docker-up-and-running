    This talk from QCon SF is a step-by-step, live-coding class on how to write automated tests for infrastructure
    code, including the code you write for use with tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and Packer. Topics
    covered include unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, test parallelism, retries, error handling, static
    analysis, and more.

  description: |
    This talk from HashiConf 2018 is a concise masterclass on how to write infrastructure code. I share key lessons
    from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork while creating and maintaining a library of over
    300,000 lines of infrastructure code that's used in production by hundreds of companies. Come and hear our war
    stories, laugh about all the mistakes we’ve made along the way, and learn what Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Go
    look like in the wild.

  description: |
    This is my talk from HashiConf 2017 where I introduce the work we've been doing at Gruntwork with Terraform Modules.
    I explain how modules work, how to design modules so they are highly configurable and reusable, and how to write
    automated tests for your Terraform code. Most importanly, I show you how you can use modules to build your entire
    tech stack on top of proven, battle-tested infrastructure code—in minutes.

    I'll be running a 2-day training course at Velocity Conference in NYC. Learn Terraform through real-world examples:
    deploy servers, DBs, and load balancers on AWS; build immutable infrastructure with Docker and Packer;
    put it all together in a continuous delivery pipeline.

    This talk is a very quick intro to Docker, Terraform, and Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS). In just 15 minutes,
    you'll see how to take two apps (a Rails frontend and a Sinatra backend), package them as Docker containers, run
    them using Amazon ECS, and to define all of the infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.
