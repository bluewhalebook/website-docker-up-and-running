#    Check out Yevgeniy Brikman's podcast interview with Software Engineering Radio on Infrastructure as Code best
#    practices. The discussion covers similarities and differences between conventional software engineering and
#    code-driven infrastructure; factoring code into modules; layering; terraform code organization for micro-services;
#    releases and tagging; code reviews; unit testing infrastructure; deployment of infrastructure; ownership and code
#    structure models; and open source and re-usable libraries.

#    This talk from HashiConf 2018 is a concise masterclass on how to write infrastructure code. I share key lessons
#    from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork while creating and maintaining a library of over
#    300,000 lines of infrastructure code that's used in production by hundreds of companies. Come and hear our war
#    stories, laugh about all the mistakes we’ve made along the way, and learn what Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Go
#    look like in the wild.

#  description: |
#    This is my talk from HashiConf 2017 where I introduce the work we've been doing at Gruntwork with Terraform Modules.
#    I explain how modules work, how to design modules so they are highly configurable and reusable, and how to write
#    automated tests for your Terraform code. Most importanly, I show you how you can use modules to build your entire
#    tech stack on top of proven, battle-tested infrastructure code—in minutes.

#    you'll see how to take two apps (a Rails frontend and a Sinatra backend), package them as Docker containers, run
#    them using Amazon ECS, and to define all of the infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.
