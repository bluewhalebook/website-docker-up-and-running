    The 2nd edition of <em>Terraform: Up & Running</em> is here! It's nearly double the length of the 1st edition
    (~160 more pages), including two completely new chapters (Production-grade Terraform Code and How to Test Terraform
    Code), and major changes to all the original chapters and code examples to take into account 4 major Terraform
    releases (everything is now updated through Terraform 0.12), the Terraform state revamp (including backends,
    locking, and workspaces), Terraform providers split, Terraform Registry, HCL2, and much more. Check out the
