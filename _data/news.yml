    This is my talk from HashiConf 2017 where I introduce the work we've been doing at Gruntworkwith Terraform Modules.
    I explain how modules work, how to design modules so they are highly configurable and reusable, and how to write
    automated tests for your Terraform code. Most importanly, I show you how you can use modules to build your entire
    tech stack on top of proven, battle-tested infrastructure codeâ€”in minutes.

    This talk is a very quick intro to Docker, Terraform, and Amazon's EC2 Container Service (ECS). In just 15 minutes,
    you'll see how to take two apps (a Rails frontend and a Sinatra backend), package them as Docker containers, run
    them using Amazon ECS, and to define all of the infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.
